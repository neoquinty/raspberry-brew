Mashing (and boiling) control for homebrewing using a Raspberry Pi 3 and:
1) electric resistance (2000W) to be inserted into worth and relay (to switch it on/off)
2) temperature probe to be inserted into worth
3) (TBD) display
4) sound warning (via omxplayer)

Current status [April 20, 2018]:
  - temperature control: WORKING
  - resistance control: WORKING
  - sound warning: WORKING by using omxplayer and audio jack
  - display: TO DO
  - notification to android phone: TO DO
 Â - better coding: TO DO

All the system is working in a single pot (almost BIAB).
